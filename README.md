# Assignment 2 ReadMe

This project is a Qt grade calculator built to calculate grades for PIC10B and PIC10C according to their 
individual grading schemas as outlined in their respective syllabi. Each class has two grading schemas,
referred to as "Schema A" and "Schema B". The calculator will compute the grade as a percentage based
on these criteria as assignment grades are input by the user. It will also automatically calculate the grade
immediately when switching from class to class and from schema to schema. Additionally, since PIC10B has 8
homework assignments and two midterms, wheras PIC10C only has 3 homework assignments, one midterm, and one
final project, the UI updates to reflect this.
